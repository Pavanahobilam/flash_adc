# âš¡ 5-bit Flash ADC with Gray Code Output

This project implements a **high-speed 5-bit Flash Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC)** using **Verilog HDL**, featuring 31 parallel comparators and a custom Gray code encoder. The design is intended for **ultra-fast and glitch-free digital conversions**, with simulation and verification performed in **ModelSim**.

## ðŸ§  Overview

Flash ADCs are the fastest type of analog-to-digital converters, leveraging parallel comparators to achieve single-clock-cycle conversion. This design improves output reliability by encoding the thermometer code into **Gray code**, which ensures only one bit changes per output level, thereby minimizing glitches and timing issues.
